# Taskmaster

Taskmaster allows users to create, update and delete tasks. Tasks can be grouped by status and users are able to search tasks based on title or name.

## Setup

```
  bundle install
  bin/rails db:setup
  bin/rails db:seed
```

### Notes

- User authentication is out of scope for this project and I will attempt to add if time permits.
